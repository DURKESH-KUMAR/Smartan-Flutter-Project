# 📱 Smartan Flutter Project

The **Smartan Flutter Project** is a Flutter-based mobile application developed by **DURKESH KUMAR S** that visualizes real-time character animation using data from a **CSV file**. This innovative approach replaces traditional animation clips by allowing motion data to be fed directly into the app, making it ideal for motion capture visualization, AI-generated animation playback, and interactive motion data simulation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Smartan Flutter allows developers and researchers to animate characters based on frame-by-frame motion data stored in a CSV file. Each frame represents transformations (positions or rotations) for different joints or bones of the character. The app reads this data and animates the character in real-time on a mobile screen.
